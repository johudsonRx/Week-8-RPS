# Week-8-RPS
 A live front-end Rock Paper Scissors game that takes players' input and stores it in a firebase database. JQuery is used to dynamically render player decisions as well as keep tallies on the game.

 Further refactoring to-do's:
 -Set up firebase to update player tallies and decisions live (two-player game).
 -Build a chatbox that is also powered by firebase.
 -Add a bit more CSS styling.
